<font face="Times New Roman" id="education" color=\#00008B size=4> I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Tsinghua University Shenzhen International Graduate School, focusing on underwater information perception and processing, and underwater intelligent robotics. I received my Ph.D. in Information and Communications Engineering from the School of Information Science and Engineering at Xiamen University, where my advisors were Professors Cheng En and Yuan Fei. I also received my B.A. in Electronic Science and Technology from the Ocean University of China. </font>
